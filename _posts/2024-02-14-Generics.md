##  Generic Methods

例子
```
public static <K,V> V get(Map61B<K,V> map, K key) {
    if map.containsKey(key) {
        return map.get(key);
    }
    return null;
}
```
在type未知的情况下引用Comparable，下面的example似乎不太行得通
毕竟Not all objects have a `compareTo` method!
```
public static <K, V> K maxKey(Map61B<K, V> map) {
    List<K> keylist = map.keys();
    K largest = map.get(0);
    for (K k: keylist) {
        if (k > largest) {
            largest = k;
        }
    }
    return largest;
}
```
接下来是改进版本
```
public static <K extends Comparable<K>, V> K maxKey(Map61B<K, V> map) {...}
```
## Type upper bounds

### why does it "extend" comparable and not "implement"?

Well, it turns out, "extends" in this context has a different meaning than in the polymorphism context.

This different use of `extends` is called type upper bounding. Confusing? That's okay, it _is_ confusing. Just remember, in the context of inheritance, the `extends` keyword is active in giving the subclass the abilities of the superclass. You can think of it as a fairy Godmother: she sees your needs and helps you out with some of her fairy magic. On the other hand, in the context of generics, `extends` simply states a fact: You must be a subclass of whatever you're extending.

**When used with generics (like in generic method headers), `extends` imposes a constraint rather than grants new abilities.**

## Summary

We’ve seen four new features of Java that make generics more powerful:

- Autoboxing and auto-unboxing of primitive wrapper types.
- Promotion/widening between primitive types.
- Specification of generic types for methods (before return type).
- Type upper bounds in generic methods (e.g. `K extends Comparable<K>`).
